# Default Zimagi SSL Certificates

These certificates are non-secure self signed SSL certificates for Zimagi development.  These are included in the official Zimagi container image on the Docker registry: **zimagi/zimagi**.

<br/>

### Do not use these certificates or the official Zimagi image except for development purposes

These certificates are not secure and will not provide adequate data security for deployed Zimagi platforms.

To generate your own production ready Zimagi container images with secure SSL certificates, see or fork the Zimagi build repository for an example, which is integrated with the CircleCI CI/CD provider:
